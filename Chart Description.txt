STI Financial Crisis 1987 - 2020
Description: Apart from the previous financial crisis. I expect Covid-19 recession to hit bottom with a much deeper 2nd dip than the 1st dip 
happened on 23Mar2020. The 1st dip didn't review the true colour of Covid-19 recession due to US $2 trillion stimulus package which much 
supported US ecomony. With the $2 trillion stimulus package running out over time and prolong Covid-19 pandemic, economy will again turn 
southward and dip for a 2nd time, which i expect it to happen in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Unless an effective vaccine is found before the 
2nd dip or another stimulus package greater than the 1st is introduce which i expect not likely to happen
