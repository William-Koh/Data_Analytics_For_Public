My view point regarding the 11 articles
Base on my pre-Election Analysis dated back on 08Jul2020 (Election date falls on 10Jul2020)

Governing party holding an Election in year 2020 has the disadvantage of the following 3 items. 
(1) Covid-19 pandemic
(2) GST
(3) Change of Leadership (Prime Minister)

During my analysis, I expect popular votes to decline for this election (vast majority Analysts expect popular 
votes to increase, expecting most vote to be casted to Governing party to fight off pandemic)

To keep my words short, I'm quite surprise, of these 11 articles, None of them mention about GST. Which i believes it 
play an important role in Election 2020
